#Amazon Sentiment Analysis

Amazon receives millions of product reviews every day. Understanding whether these reviews are positive, negative, or neutral is crucial for businesses to improve customer experience, detect issues, and identify market trends.

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques to classify Amazon customer reviews based on sentiment.

# Features

✅ Collects and processes Amazon product reviews
✅ Cleans and preprocesses text (lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization, stopword removal)
✅ Converts text into numerical features (TF-IDF, Word2Vec, or BERT embeddings)
✅ Classifies reviews into Positive, Negative, Neutral categories
✅ Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics
✅ Visualizes sentiment distribution (pie chart, bar graph, word cloud)
✅ Can be extended for real-time sentiment monitoring

# Dataset
Amazon reviews datset is used from kaggle

# Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries for Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

NLP Libraries: NLTK, SpaCy, scikit-learn

Machine Learning Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Deep Learning (optional): LSTM / BERT for advanced sentiment analysis

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud

# Project Workflow

Data Collection – Amazon review dataset (CSV/JSON)

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Remove special characters, stopwords, and duplicate reviews

Tokenize and lemmatize words

Feature Extraction

Bag of Words / TF-IDF / Word Embeddings

Model Training & Testing

Train ML models on labeled review dataset

Evaluate performance using metrics

Prediction & Visualization

Predict unseen review sentiment

Display sentiment analysis results graphically

# Objective

Help businesses understand customer opinions at scale

Detect negative feedback early to improve product/service quality

Identify trending sentiments for product marketing

Provide a foundation for real-time sentiment analysis systems

# Example Output

Sentiment Distribution:

Positive: 65%

Negative: 25%

Neutral: 10%

Word Cloud showing most frequent positive/negative words

Confusion matrix showing model performance

# Future Enhancements

Integrate with a dashboard (Streamlit/Flask/Django) for live analysis

Use transformer-based models (BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT) for higher accuracy

Perform aspect-based sentiment analysis (detect if review talks about delivery, price, quality)

Deploy model on cloud (AWS/GCP/Azure) for scalability

✨ This project demonstrates the power of NLP in extracting insights from large-scale customer reviews and can be applied in e-commerce, marketing, and customer support analytics.
